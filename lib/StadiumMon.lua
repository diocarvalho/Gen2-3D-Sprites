-- STADIUM battles: one Pokemon, standing on its tile.
--
-- The side's live state -- which species is out, the rig posing it, which
-- animation the fight has asked for and how far through it is, and the
-- matrix that puts it on its cell at the right size facing the right way.
-- Stadium owns the pair of these; StadiumRig owns the arithmetic.
--
-- ------- how big a Pokemon is
--
-- The one genuinely invented number in this mode, and it is worth saying
-- why it is invented rather than measured.
--
-- The flat 2D-3D mode has an exact answer: a full-size 56-pixel pic covers
-- one 16-pixel overworld square, so a canvas pixel is a fixed number of
-- world pixels and every species comes out at whatever its own artwork's
-- size implies (see BattleBillboard.FULL_W). The camera is then SOLVED to
-- make one square that big on screen (BattleCam).
--
-- The Stadium models have no such anchor. Their units are the N64's, they
-- run from Caterpie at 9 units to Gyarados at 147 -- a sixteenfold spread,
-- where the Gen 1 pics span barely one and a half -- and the game they come
-- from framed each one with its own camera, which a fight staged on the
-- overworld cannot do because the two mons share a shot.
--
-- Taken literally, that spread puts Caterpie at a couple of pixels on a
-- 144-pixel screen while Gyarados leaves the frame. So the range is
-- COMPRESSED rather than either honoured or discarded: a species is drawn
-- at REF_HEIGHT world pixels scaled by its own height over the set's
-- median, raised to SQUASH. At 1 that would be the raw sixteenfold spread;
-- at 0 every Pokemon would be the same size; at 0.55 the order and the
-- feel of the differences survive -- Onix and Gyarados tower, Diglett and
-- Caterpie are small enough to have to look for -- inside a range a shared
-- frame can hold.
--
-- ------- and where its feet are
--
-- The pack measures each model's lowest point against its own origin
-- (tools/stadium_pack.py's `stance`), and the answer splits the set in
-- three. 119 species sit within 5% of zero: the origin IS the floor, and
-- the game stood them on its field with it. A handful sit ABOVE it --
-- Zubat, Magnemite, Geodude -- which is a hover the model is authored with.
-- The rest hang BELOW it -- Tentacruel, Gastly, Haunter, Weezing, Zapdos --
-- which is a model centred on its origin rather than standing on it.
--
-- So a model is stood on its own lowest point, and then given back as much
-- of its authored hover as the shot can hold -- HOVER_CAP of its own height,
-- no more. The middle group is unaffected either way, which is the check
-- that the rule is reading the data rather than correcting it.
--
-- The cap is not tidiness. Stadium framed one Pokemon per camera and could
-- afford to hang Zubat three body-heights off the floor; this shot has the
-- foe's feet on GB row 56 of 144, so the same hover puts Zubat off the top
-- of the frame entirely -- which is exactly what it did before the cap. The
-- flat 2D-3D mode has the same constraint and answers it by bottom-aligning
-- every pic, hovering species included; this keeps the hover but spends
-- only the room there is.

-- How tall a median Pokemon stands, in world pixels.

-- A full-size Gen 1 pic is 56 pixels for the foe and 64 for the player's
-- own, drawn with its feet on GB rows 56 and 96 of a 144-row frame -- so a
-- full-size mon covers 39% of the frame at the far cell and 44% at the near
-- one. Against the lens BattleCam solves (about 38 world pixels of frame at
-- the far cell, 30 at the near one, because the near one is closer) both of
-- those work out at roughly fourteen world pixels.
--
-- So this is the number that makes a median Stadium model exactly as big as
-- the artwork it replaces, which is what keeps the composition the camera
-- was solved for.

-- (BattleState.growInScale). Two things about that do not carry to a model.
--
-- It is three steps, which on a 56-pixel sprite is a chunky pop and on a
-- smooth 3D model is just a pop. And it starts AFTER the ball: measured, the
-- poof animation runs for 27 frames and `startGrowIn` fires on the frame
-- after it ends, so the Pokemon does not begin to exist until the ball has
-- finished opening -- which reads as the ball opening and then a Pokemon
-- being switched on beside it.
--
-- So the model runs its own ramp, started when the POOF begins rather than
-- when it ends, and continuous rather than stepped: it grows out of nothing
-- while the ball is opening and reaches full size as the engine's own grow
-- finishes. GROW_TIME is measured off that -- 27 frames of poof plus the
-- engine's 12 of grow is 39, which is this.

-- at the far cell, with the foe's feet on row 56 of 144 -- so there is
-- roughly one body-height of room above it and about one and a half either
-- side. Three quarters of a height keeps every part of a travelling Pokemon
-- inside that with a margin, and leaves the 83 species that never reach it
-- untouched.
StadiumMon.TRAVEL = 0.75

-- ------- the animation the fight is asking for
--
-- Each entry says which context slot to look up, whether it loops, and
-- what it falls back to when the species has no animation in that slot.
-- ------- the defender reaction
--
-- This used to carry `hit` and `flinch` states, played when damage landed,
-- resolving through context slots 166 and 178. Both were wrong, and the data
-- says so plainly once the move table is read alongside them:
--
--   Bulbasaur's slot 166 is a 95-frame animation that 66 of its moves play.
--   Pidgey's is 138 frames -- four and a half seconds -- and 111 of its moves
--   play it. Slot 178, and 173, 179, 180 and 181, all point at the same one.
--
-- A four-and-a-half-second animation that most of the move table uses is the
-- species' DEFAULT ATTACK, not a flinch, which is why being hit looked like
-- swinging: it literally was the swing.
--
-- Stadium's defender-impact handler instead requests context slot 168 for
-- ordinary and super-effective damage. That slot is also used for entrance:
-- Stadium deliberately reuses the same species-specific recovery motion in
-- both contexts. Resisted damage selects idle and is filtered by Stadium.hit
-- before it reaches this state machine.

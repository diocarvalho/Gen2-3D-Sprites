-- Voxel world mode: the third-person camera -- the 3RD rung.
--
-- 3RD is 1ST with the eye pulled off the back of the head. Everything that
-- makes the first-person rung work -- the steered attitude, the placed
-- camera on Voxel3D's seam, the cards that turn to face the eye, the
-- continuous camera-relative walk -- is already general over WHERE the eye
-- stands, so this module adds exactly one thing to it: a BOOM.
--
-- What the boom owns:
--
--   the LENGTH    how far behind the pivot the eye sits, eased in and out
--                 so stepping between 1ST and 3RD slides rather than cuts,
--                 and clamped every frame by what the world will allow.
--
--   the COLLISION a march back along the boom line through the terrain
--                 height field and the map's own walkability, so backing
--                 into a wall walks the camera in toward the player's
--                 shoulders instead of through the wall into the void.
--                 The recovery is deliberately slower than the intrusion:
--                 a camera must never be a frame late leaving geometry,
--                 and must never snap back out the instant a corner clears.
--
--   the SHOULDER  the small lateral rail offset that keeps the character
--                 off dead centre, faded out with the boom so a camera
--                 jammed against a wall does not also slide sideways into
--                 it.
--
-- Deliberately NOT here: the attitude, the look inputs, the blend, the
-- move intent (all lib/FirstPerson.lua, which drives this module and reads
-- its answer while building the frame's rig), and movement itself
-- (lib/FreeMove.lua, unchanged -- the walk is camera-relative either way,
-- and the camera's yaw is the same number on both rungs).
--
-- Nothing here is required for the rung to draw: with no overworld to ask
-- (a headless run, the test suite) every query answers "clear" and the boom
-- extends to its full length over an empty world.

-- the mod namespace (see main.lua): V.require loads a sibling module

-- collides a Kanto camera boom against Johto and can collapse THIRD PERSON

-- ------- the boom's numbers
--
-- BOOM is world pixels behind the pivot at full extension. A cell is 16 and
-- a character card is 16 tall, so 48 stands the camera three cells back:
-- with the first-person lens (65 degrees vertical) that frames the player
-- at roughly a quarter of the frame height -- the modern action-game
-- middle ground, close enough to read the four-frame sprite and far enough
-- to see the cell you are about to walk into.
--
-- PIVOT_LIFT raises the orbit point above the first-person eye, so the
-- boom looks slightly DOWN across the player's shoulder rather than
-- straight through the back of their head.
--
-- SHOULDER is the lateral rail offset, in world pixels, positive to the
-- camera's right -- which puts the player left of centre, leaving the
-- larger half of the frame in front of them.
ThirdPerson.BOOM = 48
ThirdPerson.PIVOT_LIFT = 4
ThirdPerson.SHOULDER = 4

-- The 2D trainer card is presentation art, not a physical 16px-tall slab that
-- should balloon just because the third-person eye is close to it.  At the
-- normal 48px boom the old world-space card occupied roughly a quarter of a
-- phone-height frame, and a collision-compressed/zoomed boom could make it
-- suddenly enormous.  Keep the card's apparent height capped by shrinking its
-- world-space presentation size in direct proportion to the ACTUAL boom
-- length.  Because perspective size is also proportional to 1/distance, the two
-- cancel and the player stays visually stable while NPCs/world geometry keep
-- ordinary perspective.
--
-- REFERENCE is the distance at which a native 16px trainer reaches full size;
-- farther away we never enlarge it above its authored dimensions.  The minimum
-- only protects the transition frame where the boom is almost inside the head;
-- FirstPerson.hidePlayer removes the card completely once it is truly too close.

-- ------- the player's own zoom
--

-- CamControl, which owns every one of those and decides which camera a
-- given input is aimed at). The range is deliberately wider IN than OUT:
-- close is the shot people reach for, and far enough out the character is
-- a few pixels and the rung may as well be an orbit rung.
--
-- Stepped in fractions rather than world pixels so a notch feels the same
-- at both ends -- the near end of a linear step would crawl and the far
-- end would leap.

-- four halvings of a 4px step lands the eye within a quarter pixel of the
-- face, which is finer than the boom ever needs to be.
--
-- PAD is the clearance kept between the eye and whatever stopped it. It
-- has to beat the placed camera's near plane (|eye - focus| * 0.05, which
-- at full extension is about 3.6 world pixels -- see Voxel3D) or the near
-- plane clips a hole in the very wall the boom stopped at.
--
-- CLEAR is how high above a cell's ground the eye must be to pass OVER
-- something unwalkable rather than being stopped by it: a fence, a kerb or
-- a plant pot should not shove the camera in, a building should. Roughly
-- head height, so the eye clears the props and never the walls.

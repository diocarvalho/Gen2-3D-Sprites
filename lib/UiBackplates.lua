-- The three battle-UI backplate options added for the 1.66 update:
--
--   C) SPRITE LIGHT  UNLIT / SHADED   -- whether the mon cards receive the
--      world's day tint and cast shadows (SHADED) or draw flat and full
--      bright (UNLIT). UNLIT keeps them readable on the white arena fill (B);
--      SHADED is the default OG look and is also supported on white.
--
--   B) ARENA FILL    WHITE / OFF       -- a solid white rendering layer in
--      front of the whole voxel world, with only the mons, their attack
--      animations and the menus above it. Hides the 3D terrain while keeping
--      the animated sprites -- the middle step between the OG battle and the
--      full voxel one. Works with SHADED or UNLIT sprites (UNLIT just keeps
--      the cards brighter on white).
--
--   A) TEXTBOX FILL was dropped: the battle box is now ALWAYS an opaque white
--      panel with black ink (the same as the overworld / trainer-intro
--      textbox), so there is no HALF / OFF toggle to manage. See
--      BattleState:drawTextArea in OverworldBattle.lua.

-- Each is a ModSetting: it gets an OPTIONS-menu row and a mod-manager schema
-- for free, and persists under options.modOptions.BATTLE_ART_VOXEL_FORK like the
-- others. Defining them here -- rather than inline in main.lua -- keeps the
-- three of them, and the render-path queries they answer, in one place.

-- the mod namespace (see main.lua): V.require loads a sibling module
local V = ...

local ModSetting = V.require("ModSetting")

local UiBackplates = {}

-- ------- C) SPRITE LIGHT -------

 UiBackplates.spriteLight = ModSetting.new("spriteLight", "SPRITE LIGHT",
   { "SHADED", "UNLIT" }, { "SHADED", "UNLIT" })

-- Whether the mon cards should be drawn flat and full bright (UNLIT) rather
-- than receiving the world's day tint and shadows (SHADED). ARENA FILL: WHITE
-- forces this on: a solid white battle field carries no night tint -- as in
-- the traditional games -- so the sprites draw flat and true-colour
-- regardless of the SPRITE LIGHT setting.
function UiBackplates.spritesUnlit()
  if UiBackplates.arenaWhite() then return true end
  return false
end

-- ------- B) ARENA FILL -------

UiBackplates.arenaFill = ModSetting.new("arenaFill", "ARENA FILL",
  { "OFF", "WHITE" }, { "OFF", "WHITE" })

-- Whether to draw the solid white layer over the voxel world. Decoupled from
-- sprite light: it works with SHADED cards too (they just read a little
-- dimmer on white), so WHITE is offered independently of UNLIT.
function UiBackplates.arenaWhite()
  return UiBackplates.arenaFill:get() == "WHITE"
end

-- ------- the backplate is applied in OverworldBattle.drawTextArea
--
-- The battle box is ALWAYS drawn as an opaque white panel with black ink by
-- BattleState:drawTextArea (see whiteBoxFill there). TEXTBOX FILL was dropped
-- because the white panel is the one predictable backplate that matches the
-- overworld / trainer-intro textbox and never produces white-on-white.

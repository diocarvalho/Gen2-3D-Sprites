-- Voxel world mode: what this device can afford.
--
-- Every other module in this mod was written against a desktop GPU, where
-- the scene canvas is the window, the shadow map is 2048 texels of it, and
-- both are redrawn from scratch every frame the camera moves a quarter of a
-- world pixel. On a two-core mobile Mali that is three separate ways to
-- miss the frame at once:
--
--   FILL   the scene renders at the panel's own pixel count. A 1080p
--          phone is 2.6 megapixels, against the 23 thousand the flat 2D
--          path shades -- a hundredfold, through a shader with six
--          texture fetches in it, on geometry that leans on the depth
--          buffer instead of a y-sort and therefore overdraws freely.
--          Worse, both passes `discard`, which switches a tile-based GPU
--          out of early-Z for the whole draw: none of that overdraw is
--          rejected before it is shaded.
--
--   SUN    the shadow map's rung is picked to resolve 0.45 world pixels
--          per texel. Work that target against a phone's view size and
--          every rung below 2048 fails it, so the ladder is decorative
--          and the map is always the top one -- 4.2 million more texels,
--          again with a discarding shader, again redrawn whenever the
--          camera moves.
--
--   BAND   each of those is a full-screen render target on a memory bus
--          that has about a tenth of a desktop's headroom, and every
--          canvas switch on a tiler is a resolve and a reload.
--
-- So: two rows the player can turn down on the device, because there is no
-- benchmarking a phone from here.
--
--   RES      the divisor the 3D pass renders at before it is scaled back
--            up to the panel. This is the one that matters -- it is
--            quadratic in every one of the three costs above, so 1/2 is
--            four times less of all of it and 1/3 is nine.
--
--   SHADOWS  LOW keeps real cast shadows but on a quarter-size map, one
--            tap instead of four, no neighbour maps casting, and redrawn
--            every other frame while walking. OFF drops the sun pass
--            entirely and the mod falls back to the flat decal shadows it
--            already carries for drivers without a depth canvas. SOFT is
--            the rung ABOVE the original: everything HIGH does, plus a
--            blocker search that widens each shadow's edge by how far it
--            stands from what throws it.
--
-- Both default to the cheap end. A desktop player who installs this build
-- sets them back to FULL / HIGH and gets the original mod exactly: at
-- scale 1 the render path is the same canvas it always was with no extra
-- blit, and at HIGH every constant below is the number it used to be. FULL
-- is one step off the default rather than three, because on a desktop it is
-- where most people are going.

-- The ladder is ordered so values[1] -- ModSetting's default, and its

-- it finds (see SUN_SOFT in the scene shader). Twelve fetches against four,
-- which is a desktop's price and not a phone's, so it sits at the top of
-- the ladder and nothing arrives at it by default.

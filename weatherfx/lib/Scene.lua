-- WHAT THE FRAME IS SHOWING.
--
-- The present stage is handed almost nothing -- `{ width, height, scale,
-- dpi }` and a canvas -- and does not say whether the thing under that
-- canvas is the overworld, a battle, or the PC's item screen.  Weather
-- over a full-screen menu would be a bug in every graphics mode, so this
-- module answers the questions the draw path needs, once per frame, from
-- the live game.
--
--   visible     "world" | "battle" | "hidden"
--   outdoor     whether the map the player is standing on has a sky
--   camera      world-pixel scroll, so ground splashes stay on the ground
--   textBox     the rect of an open dialog box, or nil
--
-- THE STACK WALK is the whole trick, and it is four lines: from the top of
-- the state stack downward, the first state that is a battle means battle,
-- the first that is the overworld means world, and the first that is
-- opaque before either means the world is covered and nothing should draw.
-- Transparent overlays -- a text box, a "?" bubble, a quantity box -- are
-- stepped through, which is why weather keeps falling during dialogue.
--
-- That walk gets one behaviour for free that would otherwise need a
-- special case: Dramatic Shape's overworld battles set
-- `BattleState.isOpaque = self:bgMode() ~= "world"`, so a 3D battle fought
-- on the map is a NON-opaque battle with the world live behind it.  The
-- walk reports "battle" with the overworld still resolvable underneath,
-- and `drawScale` uses the opacity to decide whether the world behind
-- needs weather (it does) or whether the battle canvas has it already
-- (lib/BattleDraw.lua, through the battle.overlay hook).
--
-- THE TEXT BOX IS TRACKED so precipitation can be kept off it on the flat
-- renderer.  With a world pipeline running, weather composites under the
-- UI and the question does not arise; without one, `present` is the only
-- stage there is and it lands over everything.  Knowing where the box is
-- turns that from a limitation into a clip.
--
-- PERMISSIONS.  This is what `engine_internals` in the manifest buys, and
-- all it buys: four read-only requires and no writes.  `mod.world` would
-- give the overworld without the permission but not the stack top, and
-- "is a menu covering the world" is the question that keeps rain off the
-- item screen.  Every require is pcall'd, so a headless run reports
-- "hidden" and the mod draws nothing rather than throwing inside a render
-- callback.

-- The live overworld anywhere in the stack, battle or menu on top or not.
-- The same scan mod.world:overworld() does, for the same reason:
-- Game.overworld is the fast path but the stack is the authority.
-- THE GOLD BUG THIS FIXES: nothing drew on a Gold boot -- weather changed,
-- battle effects applied, the OPTIONS row worked, and the screen stayed
-- empty. The cause was here. The stack scan below looks for `isOverworld`,
-- a marker only Gen 1's OverworldState carries
-- (src/world/OverworldController.lua:31); Gold's world
-- (src/world/gen2/World.lua) does not set it, and the `Game.overworld`
-- fallback demands the same marker. So on Gold this answered nil, Scene.now
-- stayed "hidden", and every draw path concluded there was nothing to draw
-- over. Only drawing asked the question, which is why everything else
-- looked fine.
--
-- `mod.world:overworld()` is the engine's own answer to "where is the live
-- world", it is `backed` on both generations in the Gen 2 adapter's coverage
-- table, and each arm resolves it the way its own engine stores the world --
-- Gen 1 by the same stack scan, Gold by `game.world`. Asking it first means
-- this file no longer has to know how either engine keeps its world.
--
-- The scan is kept as a fallback rather than deleted: it is what answers if
-- `mod.world` is ever unavailable (it is built by the loader, so a very
-- early call can precede it), and on Gen 1 it returns the identical object.

  -- screen. `overworld()` is the same lookup Scene.sample uses, which asks
  -- the engine's own API first and is correct on both generations.

-- HAS THIS MAP GOT A SKY?
--
-- `Map.isOutdoor(def)` and nothing else: `def.outdoor` when the map states
-- one, otherwise `tileset == "OVERWORLD"`.
--
-- VERSION 2.3.1 ADDED A SECOND SIGNAL HERE AND IT WAS A BAD MISTAKE, worth
-- recording so it is not reinvented.  The idea was that a cave laid out
-- with outdoor tiles would wrongly pass the tileset test, so a map should
-- also have to BE the engine's `lastOutdoor` to count as having a sky.
--
-- Both halves of that were wrong.
--
--  1. `lastOutdoor` is not "the outdoor map you are on".  The engine sets
--     it on a transition OFF an outdoor map (OverworldController:4013), so
--     it records the outdoor map you last LEFT.  Walk out of a house in
--     Pallet Town and north to Route 1 and it still says PALLET_TOWN --
--     which made every route read as indoors for anyone who had ever
--     entered a building, suppressing all precipitation while leaving fog
--     and the grade drawing.  "Only fog ever appears" was that bug.
--
--  2. The problem it was solving did not exist.  Rock Tunnel, Mt Moon and
--     Victory Road use the CAVERN tileset, so `Map.isOutdoor` already
--     answered false for them.
--
-- The general lesson: a second signal can only be worth adding if its
-- meaning has been READ rather than assumed, and if the thing it fixes has
-- been seen to be broken.  Neither was true here.
--
-- Caves that genuinely do use outdoor tiles can be named in config.lua's
-- `indoorMaps`, which is an explicit list rather than a guess.

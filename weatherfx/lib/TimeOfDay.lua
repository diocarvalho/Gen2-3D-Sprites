-- TIME OF DAY: a clock, a Gold/Silver/Crystal colour grade, and the
-- engine's `world.tod` answer.
--
-- WHY THIS MOD OWNS A CLOCK AT ALL.  Version 1 borrowed Dramatic Shape's,
-- which meant that without that mod installed there was no night, and
-- "fog is likelier after dark" was dead code.  A weather system with no
-- clock is half a weather system, so this one carries its own -- and
-- still defers to Dramatic Shape when that mod is present, because two
-- clocks disagreeing about what time it is would be worse than either.
--
-- FOUR SOURCES, chosen in config.lua under `time.source`:
--
--   auto    Dramatic Shape's clock if that mod is loaded, else `cycle`.
--           The default, and the only one that needs no decision.
--   system  the device's real clock, which is what GSC actually did --
--           play at night and it is night.
--   cycle   this mod's own accelerated day, `cycleMinutes` long.
--   fixed   pinned to one phase, for screenshots and for players who
--           want the look without the schedule.
--   off     no clock, no grade, no world.tod.  Vanilla lighting.
--
-- THE PHASES are GSC's, plus one.  Gold and Silver shipped three palette
-- sets -- morning, day and night -- and Crystal kept them.  This adds EVE
-- between day and night, because the interesting half of a sunset is the
-- half GSC had no palette for, and because the grade here is a continuous
-- blend rather than three fixed palettes, so a fourth costs one table row.
-- `world.tod` publishes all four; the engine treats the value as opaque
-- and hands it to `map.palette` for palette mods to key off, so a mod that
-- only knows MORN/DAY/NITE simply never matches EVE and falls through to
-- its default -- which is the correct behaviour, not a bug.
--
-- THE GRADE IS A MULTIPLY PLUS AN ADD, not a palette swap.  A palette swap
-- is what the hardware did and would be more faithful, but it needs a
-- second full set of palettes authored per map per colour mode, and it
-- would fight every other palette mod for the same registry.  A grade over
-- the finished world costs one rectangle, works identically in every
-- colour mode the engine offers (mono, SGB, GBC, OG RED), rides through
-- GBC FX because that runs after it, and composes with weather because it
-- is drawn in the same pass by the same compositor.

-- ------- phases
--
-- `at` is the hour the phase is fully itself; the grade blends between
-- neighbours, so these are anchors rather than boundaries.  Ordering is
-- circular: NITE wraps past midnight to MORN.
--
--   mul   multiplied over the frame -- what darkens and colours it
--   add   added after -- a little light back into the shadows, which is
--         what stops a night grade reading as "the brightness is broken"
--
-- The values are tuned against GSC's own palettes rather than invented:
-- morning is a warm lift, day is exactly neutral (so DAY costs nothing at
-- all -- see `active`), evening is amber with the blue pulled down, and
-- night is the blue-violet GSC used, which darkens far less than it
-- recolours.  A night you cannot read the map through is not authentic,
-- it is just dark.

-- Morning and evening were far too timid in 2.1.x: at 09:00 the blend sat
-- around a 0.97 green and a 0.91 blue, which is under the noise floor of a
-- handheld LCD photographed in a lit room -- indistinguishable from "not
-- working".  GSC's morning palette is a genuinely visible warm shift, so
-- these now are too.  DAY stays EXACTLY neutral, which is what lets the
-- grade cost nothing at noon.
